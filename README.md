You can interact with the assistant by typing messages in the terminal.
Special commands:

exit - Quit the assistant
sync contacts - Sync contacts from Google to local database

**WhatsApp Mode (with Twilio)**

Set up a Twilio WhatsApp sandbox:

Go to the Twilio Console
Set up the WhatsApp sandbox
Configure the webhook URL to point to your server's /webhook endpoint


Start the assistant in WhatsApp mode:
bashpython -m app.main --mode twilio

Expose your webhook endpoint using ngrok for testing:
bashngrok http 5000

Update your Twilio webhook URL with the ngrok URL.
Send a message to the WhatsApp number provided by Twilio.

**Example Commands**

"Schedule a meeting"

# Troubleshooting

**Google API Issues**

If you encounter Google API authentication errors, delete the token.json file and restart the application to re-authenticate.
For rate limit errors, the system will automatically resume operations after waiting.

**WhatsApp Integration Issues**

Make sure your Twilio account is properly set up with WhatsApp sandbox.
Ensure your webhook URL is accessible from the internet.
Check that your webhook URL is correctly configured in Twilio.

**Contact Syncing Issues**

If contact syncing fails, run sync contacts again after 1-2 minutes.
Ensure your Google People API is enabled and properly authenticated.
